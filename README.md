# Deep-learning-for-automatic-diagnosis-of-lung-diseases

This project consists of detecting lung diseases from 3D CT Scans. Different architectures of Neural Networks has been trained and tested to make the predictions.

The architectures developed include :

- RNN (LSTM, GRU)
- 2D CNN + LSTM
- Convolutional LSTM
- 3D CNN

The best architecture has an accuracy of **96%**, based on a test set of 200 CT Scans.

**Technologies** : TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
